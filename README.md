# project_euler
This is a repo for my Project Euler solutions. Right now I'm just doing them in JavaScript, because I can secretly test them in the browser at work (they wont even let me use onlie IDE's for other languages!)

My development environment for now is Win7 "Sticky Notes" and Chrome's developer tools. More solutions in more languages to come!

If you come across a wrong answer, please email me at scott.g.mckell@gmail.com, and I will be glad and grateful for the help!
